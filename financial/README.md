# Financial Forecasting

Using subscription data from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gsagar12/dspp1), I complete ana analysis on the data including forecasting revenue, churn, and more

### Key Business Questions

- What is the overall churn rate for monthly and annual subscriptions?
- Are there any trends in sign-ups or cancellations over time? Are there any seasonal trends?
- How has the number of subscriptions changed over time?
- What is the lifetime value of a customer?
- Is there a difference in churn rates between different customer segments?
- Can we predict or forecast future sign-ups and cancellations based on historical data?
- What is the expected ARR for the next quarter, year, or longer?
- How much uncertainty is there in our forecasts? How can we account for this uncertainty?
- Can we identify any leading indicators that could help us improve our forecasts?
- What is the expected growth rate for monthly and annual subscriptions in the next year?
- How can we adjust our pricing strategies to optimize revenue while minimizing churn?
- Can we create scenario-based forecasts to assess the impact of various events, such as new product - launches, changes in the competitive landscape, or economic downturns?
